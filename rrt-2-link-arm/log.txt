Why dists is doubled?
It indeed doubles the distance

index(dataset,...)
dataset has to be initialized. Otherwise, the unintializd part will be zero. for example
Matrix<double> dataset(new double[2],1,2);
Index<L2<double> > index(dataset,...)
Now even though dataset doesn't initialize. It's default value will be (0,0). Put it another way, when you add points, your points will be added at index 1 instead of 0;

Now it only work given inital joint values and final joint values. 
It must be improved by given inital joint values and final end-effactor coordinations.
Leave this task until collision check has been done;
