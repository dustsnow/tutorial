That's it really. You usually write here. If you want a new paragraph, you need to make a newline
in the .tex

file just like this. Every paragraph is indented by default. If you want to include math, use
the \$ symbol at each end of your equation just like this: $x + y = 0.0$. There is tons of examples
online that you can refer to if you have any specific questions but for now this should suffice.
